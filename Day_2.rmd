How can we know that X causes Y? We review the framework of causal inference and why most academic studies *cannot* prove that X causes Y. We practice making the three fundamental critiques: omitted variables, reverse causation and selection bias.

## Afternoon - Practicing Critiques

Imagine you are asked to review some articles for a journal. In groups, actively read the following papers and prepare multiple critiques of each study, which you will present later. Try to critique each paper for (i) omitted variable bias, (ii) self-selection bias and (iii) reverse causation. Include a causal diagram which highlights the problems you have identified. The readings are available on the Summer School portal.

## Afternoon - Critiquing the Data

Yesterday we ran the observational regression to answer the question: “Does incumbency in Brazil improve your performance at the next election?”. Today we will consider some reasons why our results might not give us a good answer to that question. 

Let's start with why some observations are 'treated' and others 'control'.   

1. Briefly describe the treatment assignment process for all of the units in the data.   
2. How is the treatment assignment process different for units close to the discontinuity threshold (where winning margin is close to zero)?

One causal critique might be that there is confounding/omitted variable bias: More effective or popular parties are more likely to become incumbents and also to perform better at the next election.  

3. To try and adjust for this, add a control for party (equivalently, a fixed effect for party). How does this affect the results?  
4. We probably want a wider range of controls to address other sources of omitted variable bias. Add controls for population, IDHM (Human Development Index) and PIB (GDP per capita) to your regression, one at a time. How does this affect your results?  
5. What happens if you add all the controls at the same time?

A different causal critique is that there may be selection bias. Perhaps incumbent parties who realized they are unpopular decided not to run again?

6. We do not have these parties in our 2004 dataset, but to estimate how severe this problem might be, calculate what percentage of incumbent parties who ran in 2000 decided NOT to run again in 2004. Is this high or low?  
7. We also want to know whether the parties that did not compete again were different from those that did. We don’t have any polling data from just before the 2004 elections to understand if weak parties were more likely to not run, but we can use the results of the 2000 election to try and identify ‘weaker’ and ‘stronger’ parties. Did parties that ran again in 2004 receive a higher share of the vote in 2000 that those that decided not to run again in 2004?
