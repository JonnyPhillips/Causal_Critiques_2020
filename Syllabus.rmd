# Course Objectives

This course will give students the tools and confidence to understand, deconstruct, interpret and critique political science research papers. By encouraging participants to ground analysis and critiques of both quantitative and qualitative research in the framework and language of causation, the course hones vital skills for identifying hidden assumptions, weighing the strength of evidence and suggesting alternative explanations. 

The course also underlines the importance of making critiques constructive by suggesting alternative research designs and a wide range of robustness checks. By the end of the course, participants will be confident contributing to class discussions, peer review processes, or as journal referees, and will also gain new perspectives on how to design and execute their own research.

The teaching approach aims to systematize the types of interpretation and critique we can make so that participants are able to identify plausible reasons why the account offered by an author might not be valid. While the course covers interpretation and critique of measurement, theory and modeling, we focus particularly on interpretation and critique of causation, including risks of selection, confounding and reverse causation, demystifying terms such as ‘counterfactual’, ‘complier’ and ‘external validity’. In turn, we consider how to make critiques constructive – first, in the way they are communicated, and, second, in identifying positive research strategies that can overcome or mitigate common critiques, for example alternative research designs and robustness tests.

We will use the afternoon lab sessions to practice honing our interpretation of the evidence and formulating effective and constructive critiques. Building on examples drawn from a wide range of papers across the fields of political science and international relations, participants will develop and compare critiques in a range of styles and across diverse methodologies. Participants will also have the option (no obligation or expectation) of sharing their own research ideas and papers to receive feedback from others. The lab sessions will also include the replication of code from a published analysis to highlight the range of modelling options researchers are faced with and the breadth of potential critiques that this opens up. The replication exercises will be guided and can be completed in Stata or R (recommended).

# Course Logistics

The course will take place between January 29 - February 2, 2024 in Room [TBC] in the [Faculdade de Filosofia, Letras e Ciências Humanas (FFLCH)](https://www.google.com.br/maps/place/FFLCH+-+Pr%C3%A9dio+de+Letras/@-23.5618195,-46.7275296,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x94ce5640eb6f8a59:0x6f53a42abbe26c0c!8m2!3d-23.5618195!4d-46.7253409) from 9am - 6pm. You do not require your own laptop - where we will use computers for the replication exercises we will use a dedicated laboratory with the necessary software pre-installed.

Participants should have a basic understanding of research design and quantitative methods techniques. All courses in the second week of the IPSA-USP Summer School meet this requirement.

# Pre-course Readings

Because the course will involve intensive discussion and lab sessions, you may find it valuable to read some of the reading materials listed for each day before the start of the course. All readings can be found on the IPSA-USP Summer School enrollment portal. 

The papers that we will be discussing and critiquing during the afternoon lab sessions will be provided to you during the course.
