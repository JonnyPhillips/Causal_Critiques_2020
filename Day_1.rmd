We discuss what constitutes a convincing argument, the nature of causation, and how a paper can contribute to learning in the discipline. Then we learn to systematically translate the text of a paper into the core elements of a research argument; the units of analysis, the comparisons, the concepts, the measures, the assumptions, the theory, the models, the evidence and the conclusions. Finally, we consider basic critiques of whether the measures reflect the concepts, whether the model captures the theory, and whether the conclusions follow from the premises and evidence.

## Morning

*Lab Exercise:* We practice quickly deconstructing the complex arguments of published papers into simple categories, causal statements and causal diagrams.

*Lab Replication Exercise:* We familiarize ourselves with a published research paper to understand the research question, research design and key features of the data. 

## Afternoon - Practicing Critiques

We will practice rapidly reading, understanding and summarizing academic arguments. You should complete the [Paper Summary Template](https://jonnyphillips.github.io/Causal_Critiques_2020/Day 1/Paper_summary_template.pdf) for two of the following papers (available on the Summer School portal):  
a. Titiunik 2011  
b. Maoz and Russett 1993
c. Ross 2001
d. Cruz and Schneider 2017
e. Carnegie and Marinov 2017
  
## Afternoon - Critiquing the Data

For the next five days we will use the study by [Titiunik 2011](https://jonnyphillips.github.io/Causal_Critiques_2020/Day 1/Papers/Titiunik 2011.pdf) to help understand what is happening in the data when we make a causal argument/critique.
