The paper by Boas and Hidalgo 2010 (accessible in the portal of the Summer School) uses a regression discontinuity and matching to argue that elected politicians are more likely to receive community radio licences, and that politicians with community radio licences have a much higher chance of being elected. Based on this study, the Ministry of Communications has proposed to ban all candidates for elected office from owning radio licences. 

Your task is to write a report for the Ministry: Should this ban go ahead? Does the evidence from Boas and Hidalgo provide strong justification for this ban? What do we learn and what do we *not* learn from their research?
