We consider various strategies and techniques for overcoming weaknesses in an argument. These include the use of alternative research designs, complementary qualitative data, deriving multiple tests from theory, uncovering ‘hidden’ units, robustness tests, heterogeneity tests and placebo tests. We also talk about how to frame and articulate critiques in ways which motivate rather than discourage.

## Afternoon - Practicing Critiques

Students present a research paper of their own, or a paper allocated by the teacher if preferred, making the most convincing causal case possible. Other students then present constructive critiques and suggest improvements.
