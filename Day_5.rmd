## Morning

1. [Lecture Slides](https://jonnyphillips.github.io/Causal_Critiques/Day 5/Slides_Day_5_v1.pdf)

## Afternoon - Practicing Critiques

We will continue with your individual presentations of your own/assigned papers, and the rest of the class will be tasked with providing constructive critiques.

## Afternoon - Critiquing the Data

1. One theory for why incumbents may do better at the next election is due to access to state resouces. So we might expect the incumbency effect to be more positive (less negative) where state resources are more important, i.e. in the North/Northeast, and more negative in the Southeast. Implement a heterogeneity test to compare the results for just Minas Gerais (MG) and Piaui (PI).

2. Design an additional test that we could implement that would provide additional evidence that incumbency has a negative electoral impact.
