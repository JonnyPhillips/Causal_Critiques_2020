The following are observational studies that have been conducted by political scientists. Propose an alternative methodology (an experiment or quasi-experiment) that might support a more convincing causal argument in each context, and describe the assumptions required for the methodology to be successful:

1. Voters with more information about politicians' performance are more likely to reward good governance.

2. Municipalities with biometric voting have highter turnout.

3. Voters prefer indigenous candidates to black candidates

4. Receiving government news broadcasts makes you more trusting in government.

5. Natural resource revenues discourage investments in education.

6. Reforming the police can reduce violence.
